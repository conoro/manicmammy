				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sunday May 1st at 10am saw myself, 3 of my siblings and other pals running through a forest in Virginia, Co. Cavan. Why? I hear you ask. Well, it was the first <a href="https://www.jailbreak.ie" target="_blank">Jailbreak 10km trail run</a>. We were going to be up and about early anyway as our Dad&#8217;s anniversary mass was taking place at 8am so we jumped into the car after it and a quick drive to Virginia later, we were set.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/vj1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2603" style="margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px;" title="vj" src="https://www.manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/vj1.jpg" alt="" width="441" height="107" /></a></p>
<p>Some runners were assigned to be &#8220;prisoners&#8221; and they started the run a minute before the runners who were assigned to be &#8220;guards&#8221; took off in pursuit. Each guard was supposed to try and catch the same bib numbered prisoner. Alas I was the guard who was supposed to catch my prisoner brother who had recently completed the Paris marathon. No chance. The sibling rivalry kicked in and he took off!</p>
<p>It was great fun. The morning was gorgeous, sun out, bluebells growing in the forest. Some of the trail was along the lake so plenty of lovely vistas to keep us distracted from the running. We all thoroughly enjoyed it. For €25 registration fee, everyone received either an orange prisoner or a navy guard t-shirt, a handcuff shaped finisher&#8217;s medal and water en-route and at the finish line.</p>
<p>I would definitely recommend this trail run and intend to take part again next year. Good craic and a lovely way to start the day!</p>
