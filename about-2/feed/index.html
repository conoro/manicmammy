		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the follow on twitter today. I am just down the road from you in Clonakilty. Many years ago I also did the WSET. Only exam I ever got a distinction in my life!!!
My wesbite is just being developed but when it is properly live check it out as there will be some free resources on transforming family dynamics which you are welcome to. 
Best wishes

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Manicmammy. Just saw your comment on Sour Grapes about having a wine tasting here in Cork. We are a group of girls (mostly but we are opening up) who meet every 2 months and nejoy some great wine. Check out the blog. Our next wine tasting is tomorrow (sorry, saw your comment too late). Email me if you are interested in joining us (no commitment, no fees and absloutely no fuss ;-).
