				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the highlights of my year is definitely running the Amsterdam marathon in October. It had been 7 years since I had run that distance and I was apprehensive about doing it all again. For one reason or another there had not been many half marathons in Ireland that I had been able to attend this year but I started the marathon training. So myself and <a href="https://www.conoroneill.com" target="_blank">Conor</a> were looking for a venue mid to late October that was running both a marathon and a half marathon.</p>
<p>My brother and some of his mates had already enrolled so we decided to head to Amsterdam too. To be fair, its handy to get to from both Dublin and Cork and we had no problems in booking reasonably priced accommodation near the Centraal Station. The marathon was due to start at 9.30 am with the half marathon starting 4 hours later. It was a gorgeous sunny, cool Autumnal morning.</p>
<p>The race started in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Stadium_(Amsterdam)" target="_blank">Olympic Stadium</a> which was a short train away. The Olympic stadium was an awesome venue.</p>
<p><a href="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Olympic_stadium1.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2650 alignnone" style="margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px; border: 1px solid gray;" title="Olympic_stadium1" src="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Olympic_stadium1-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="442" height="294" /></a></p>
<p>The course was about as flat as you can get which suited me down to the ground. There was a terrific atmosphere and plenty of supporters cheering on the runners along the route. A lovely touch was that every runner&#8217;s number had their name printed above it. We ran along the Amstel river, past windmills, along the canals and through parks. There were plenty of well spaced water/energy drink and banana stations. My only minor gripe with these was that the water was served in plastic cups rather than bottles.</p>
<p><a href="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/FinishLine.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2642 alignnone" style="border: 1px solid gray;" title="FinishLine" src="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/FinishLine-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="452" height="301" /></a></p>
<p>I liked the occasional band or DJ playing music along the way. I would be lying if I said the theme to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-7Vu7cqB20" target="_blank">chariots of fire</a> wasn&#8217;t running through my head as I approached the finish line in Olympic Stadium <img src='https://manicmammy.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>I really enjoyed the whole day. Conor declared his post race frankfurter with sauerkraut to be probably the best he&#8217;d ever tasted.  Am definitely tempted to run it again next year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sunday May 1st at 10am saw myself, 3 of my siblings and other pals running through a forest in Virginia, Co. Cavan. Why? I hear you ask. Well, it was the first <a href="https://www.jailbreak.ie" target="_blank">Jailbreak 10km trail run</a>. We were going to be up and about early anyway as our Dad&#8217;s anniversary mass was taking place at 8am so we jumped into the car after it and a quick drive to Virginia later, we were set.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/vj1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2603" style="margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px;" title="vj" src="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/vj1.jpg" alt="" width="441" height="107" /></a></p>
<p>Some runners were assigned to be &#8220;prisoners&#8221; and they started the run a minute before the runners who were assigned to be &#8220;guards&#8221; took off in pursuit. Each guard was supposed to try and catch the same bib numbered prisoner. Alas I was the guard who was supposed to catch my prisoner brother who had recently completed the Paris marathon. No chance. The sibling rivalry kicked in and he took off!</p>
<p>It was great fun. The morning was gorgeous, sun out, bluebells growing in the forest. Some of the trail was along the lake so plenty of lovely vistas to keep us distracted from the running. We all thoroughly enjoyed it. For €25 registration fee, everyone received either an orange prisoner or a navy guard t-shirt, a handcuff shaped finisher&#8217;s medal and water en-route and at the finish line.</p>
<p>I would definitely recommend this trail run and intend to take part again next year. Good craic and a lovely way to start the day!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last December&#8217;s <a href="https://www.runclon.ie/" target="_blank">Clonakilty half marathon</a> was  good fun. Despite the morning being freezing, the atmosphere at the startline  was brilliant with music playing, runners looking forward to the off and plenty of supporters about. The run itself was enjoyable with a few hills to keep me on my toes and plenty of scenic views to keep my mind distracted.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/clonrun.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2516" style="border: 2px solid gray;" title="Clonakilty Marathon and Half Marathon" src="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/clonrun.jpg" alt="" width="451" height="251" /></a></p>
<p>Alas since then, there has been a dearth of  running events in my calendar. I need to have a race to look forward to to keep my running motivation up, so I was delighted to hear about a few upcoming half marathons.</p>
<p>First is the <a href="https://www.activeglobal.com/running/kilarney-ireland/wild-west-run-trail-half-marathon-2011" target="_blank">Wild West Run</a> which takes place on the 19th of February.  Starting at 2pm, in Kenmare and running a trail half marathon to Kilarney, along the beautiful Old Kerry way, the entry fee is €40.</p>
<p>The next is the inaugural <a href="https://www.runireland.com/events/bandon-half-marathon-and-10k" target="_blank">Bandon Half Marathon</a>. <a href="https://www.bandonac.org/wordpress/" target="_blank">Bandon Athletics Club</a> and <a href="https://bandonrfc.com/" target="_blank">Bandon Rugby Club</a> are working together to organise a 10k and half marathon on the 14th May. I&#8217;m really delighted to hear about this one. Its great value for money at an entry fee of only €20. Well done to the organisers and best of luck. I will definitely, barring catastrophy, be taking part in the <a href="https://www.bandonhalfmarathon.com/" target="_blank">Bandon run</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/corkmarathon.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2521" style="border: 2px solid gray; margin-left: 110px; margin-right: 110px;" title="cork city marathon" src="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/corkmarathon.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="307" /></a></p>
<p>Finally, in addition to the usual <a href="https://www.corkcitymarathon.ie/" target="_blank">Cork Marathon</a> taking place on June 6th, the organisers have announced a <a href="https://www.corkcitymarathon.ie/therace/halfmarathon/" target="_blank">half marathon</a> race. This is a most welcome extra race for those not inclined to tackle a full marathon nor organise a relay team. It should be a great day. The online <a href="https://www.corkcitymarathon.ie/entry/" target="_blank">entry fee</a> for this race ranges from €42 prior to 31/03/2011 to €62 in May 2011.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s me sorted for the next while. Now to put in the miles before these races&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After the <a href="https://manicmammy.com/2010/09/15/running-up-that-hill/" target="_blank">hills of Dingle</a>, we decided our next run would be somewhere flat. A google search later, we settled on Galway bay&#8217;s &#8220;fast, flat, fun and very  scenic&#8221; half marathon on October 2nd.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/galwayrun.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2387" style="border: 2px solid gray; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px;" title="galwayrun" src="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/galwayrun.jpg" alt="" width="446" height="260" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I was looking forward to this run as I thought I&#8217;d find it much easier than Dingle. However, despite completing it in a faster time, I didn&#8217;t really enjoy it as much. I did like the fact that most of the route was along the salthill promenade and so close to the sea. I didn&#8217;t like the full belt of the wind as we ran out the causeway. I didn&#8217;t enjoy doing two laps of the same course to notch up the requisite half marathon mileage. Also I discovered that I much prefer starting a run early in the morning rather than waiting till 1pm.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I prefered the atmosphere of Dingle. I loved the music at the startline there, it got everyone in top form. There seemed to be more people along the route in Kerry too.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/galway2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2393" style="border: 2px solid gray; margin-left: 11px; margin-right: 11px;" title="galway2" src="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/galway2.jpg" alt="" width="428" height="264" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That said, the <a href="www.galwaybayhalfmarathon.com" target="_blank">Galway bay half marathon</a> was, to my eyes, well organised.  The race packs contained a decent running top amongst other goodies. I relished the sambo in the finish pack and it was really nice to have a coffee in the tent after finishing as the day turned inclement. The free massages in the finishing marquee were also a nice touch.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Will probably think about doing this road race again next year but will keep my fingers crossed for less wind and I&#8217;ll know what to expect this time. Now I need to start some decent training as hoping to take part in the <a href="https://www.runclon.ie/" target="_blank">Clonakilty half marathon</a> on December 11th. It looks to have quite a few hills on the route so will be ever so slightly more challenging.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Saturday the 4th of September saw myself, my husband and a group of  my siblings and pals take part in the <a href="https://www.dinglemarathon.ie" target="_blank">Dingle half marathon</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/dingle.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2324" style="border: 2px solid gray; margin-left: 29px; margin-right: 29px;" title="dingle" src="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/dingle.jpg" alt="" width="391" height="285" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It was an early start on a Saturday morning. Luckily the holiday home we had rented for the weekend was a stone&#8217;s throw away from the start line. We ambled down after kitting ourselves out in assorted running attire, fixing our race numbers to our tops and breakfasting on various porridge, granola, toast and yoghurt combinations.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The atmosphere on the quayside was brilliant. The sun was shining and the DJ played tunes to get us in the mood to run the miles ahead.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It was a most excellent day. We each ran at our own pace. The sun shone thoroughout the duration. The scenery around Slea head and along most of the race route was breathtaking. An absolutely stunning part of the country, it did the job of distracting me from my muscles as they began to ache. There were plenty of  water stations and they were well spaced out which was just as well as the hills took their toll. The locals were out in force along the route to encourage and cheer the runners on. There were pace setters for those who wanted to keep a steady race time or beat a personal best.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I loved it and I will be back to take part in next year&#8217;s one. Check it out <a href="https://www.dinglemarathon.ie/" target="_blank">here</a>. There&#8217;s also a <a href="https://www.dinglemarathon.ie/marathon_full.html" target="_blank">full marathon</a> and <a href="https://www.dinglemarathon.ie/marathon_ultra.html" target="_blank">ultra marathon</a> on the same day for those who are much fitter and braver than I.</p>

<p>An email from <a href="https://www.dermotnolan.ie/" target="_blank">Dermot Nolan MW</a> the other day prompted me to have another look at the <a href="https://www.wset.co.uk/" target="_blank">WSET</a> <a href="https://www.dermotnolan.ie/menu-wset/menu-wset-about-diploma" target="_blank">Diploma course</a> to see whether or not I wanted to apply to do it. I really enjoyed completing the <a href="https://manicmammy.com/2009/10/31/wine-wine-wine-and-some-spirits/" target="_blank">WSET advanced course</a> and my wine knowledge increased immensely. But the diploma course is a massive jump in both money and time commitment.</p>
<p>Putting both those concerns to one side, I had a perusal through the course schedule to see what areas would be covered, what the coursework and exams entail.</p>
<p>Some of the sections really appeal to me. I would love to learn more about wine production, the light wines of the world, sparkling and fortified wines. But, if I&#8217;m to be honest, I have little interest in the whole sections on spirits or on the global business of alcoholic beverages. The coursework titles of  &#8220;The  “premiumisation” of white spirits &#8221; and &#8220;Agents,  importers and distributors&#8221; don&#8217;t fill me with enthusiasm, alas.</p>
<p>I realise that WSET courses are tailored to those in the wine trade and therefore these sections and coursework assignments are relevant.  I could ofcourse research, buy the books and do whichever sections/regions I pleased on my own. But I must admit, I really like the camraderie, the social and &#8220;having dedicated time to learn&#8221; aspects of a taught course.</p>
<p>I guess what I&#8217;m looking for is an alternative course. Is there such a thing in Ireland? Or should I just bite the bullet and consider the WSET diploma even though its not perfect for me?</p>

<p>I came across this <a href="https://mariovittone.com/2010/05/154/" target="_blank">blogpost</a>. A must read for all parents and anyone who loves the beach, lake or pool.</p>
<p>A few points that really struck home with me:</p>
<blockquote><p>Except in rare circumstances, drowning people are physiologically unable to call out for help.</p>
<p>Drowning people cannot wave for help.</p>
<p>Children playing in the water make noise. When they get quiet, you get to them and find out why.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whilst we are all looking forward to a wonderful summer on the beach and in the water, it is no harm to keep the following in mind.</p>
<p>Look for these other signs of drowning when persons are n the water:</p>
<ul>
<li>Head low in the water, mouth at water level</li>
<li>Head tilted back with mouth open</li>
<li>Eyes glassy and empty, unable to focus</li>
<li>Eyes closed</li>
<li>Hair over forehead or eyes</li>
<li>Not using legs – Vertical</li>
<li>Hyperventilating or gasping</li>
<li>Trying to swim in a particular direction but not making headway</li>
<li>Trying to roll over on the back</li>
<li>Ladder climb, rarely out of the water.</li>
</ul>
<p>I, for one, shall be revisiting <a href="https://mariovittone.com/" target="_blank">Mario&#8217;s blog </a>when he uploads a short video along with a pool safety checklist next week.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This Saturday my eldest son, aged 11, is heading for a week&#8217;s vacation on his ownio. Well ok, not totally alone. He&#8217;s holidaying with his auntie, cousins and grandparents, without me, his dad or siblings.</p>
<p>Its the longest stretch that we&#8217;ve ever been apart. I know he&#8217;s going to have a wonderful holiday, be totally well looked after and thoroughly enjoy himself. He&#8217;s very excited and can&#8217;t wait to go.  But I must admit, I&#8217;m dreading it. I&#8217;ll miss him terribly. I&#8217;m very proud of him, he&#8217;s a terrific lad. Ok, I may be ever so <em>slightly</em> biased.</p>

<p>My baby is growing up and getting more and more independent and self sufficient. Time is racing by. Guess I&#8217;d better get used to it. Now to pack his bag and make sure he has everything. Busy, busy.</p>
