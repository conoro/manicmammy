				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of Sundays ago, we awoke to a rainy dull day in Bandon. So myself and 3 of the kids decided to hit the road to Tralee. We had been meaning to try out its Aquadome for ages so it seemed like the perfect opportunity to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="www.aquadome.ie"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2574" style="border: 2px solid gray; margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px;" title="aquadome" src="http://www.manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/aquadome.jpg" alt="" width="442" height="328" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To make a long story short, we had a terrific day there, spending over 2 hours in the pool. The children loved the intervals when waves would traverse the pool. The smaller slides were perfect for the 5 year old, whilst his older siblings tackled the much larger flume slide.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The lazy river, various water showers and sprays, jacuzzi and spa pools were all tried and tested. It was great fun.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">8 year olds and younger have to wear arm bands which is no harm as parts of the pool complex have water depths which are above their heights. I felt the whole set up was very well run. There were plenty of staff and life guards keeping an eye out.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My only minor gripe is that I felt the individual changing rooms were on the small side. I would have preferred a larger family one in which we all could have been accomodated rather than the hassle of splitting the children up into their own rooms.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is quite expensive but there is a good deal on offer at the moment where you get a second family visit for half price which we availed of the following week which I guess is another indication of how much we liked the place. It was a great way to spend an otherwise dreary Sunday and I can definitely see us heading there quite often over the next few months.</p>
