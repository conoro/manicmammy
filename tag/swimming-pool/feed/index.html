				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of Sundays ago, we awoke to a rainy dull day in Bandon. So myself and 3 of the kids decided to hit the road to Tralee. We had been meaning to try out its Aquadome for ages so it seemed like the perfect opportunity to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="www.aquadome.ie"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2574" style="border: 2px solid gray; margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px;" title="aquadome" src="http://www.manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/aquadome.jpg" alt="" width="442" height="328" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To make a long story short, we had a terrific day there, spending over 2 hours in the pool. The children loved the intervals when waves would traverse the pool. The smaller slides were perfect for the 5 year old, whilst his older siblings tackled the much larger flume slide.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The lazy river, various water showers and sprays, jacuzzi and spa pools were all tried and tested. It was great fun.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">8 year olds and younger have to wear arm bands which is no harm as parts of the pool complex have water depths which are above their heights. I felt the whole set up was very well run. There were plenty of staff and life guards keeping an eye out.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My only minor gripe is that I felt the individual changing rooms were on the small side. I would have preferred a larger family one in which we all could have been accomodated rather than the hassle of splitting the children up into their own rooms.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is quite expensive but there is a good deal on offer at the moment where you get a second family visit for half price which we availed of the following week which I guess is another indication of how much we liked the place. It was a great way to spend an otherwise dreary Sunday and I can definitely see us heading there quite often over the next few months.</p>

<p class="description">As we&#8217;re up visiting Granny at the moment, myself and the eldest 4 headed to the local swimming pool yesterday. This is a 25m &#8220;L&#8221; shaped pool, basically the small part of the L is the children&#8217;s section. Its a great size and is shallow enough for the 2 year old to walk and splash comfortably around. The water was quite warm and the lifeguard was very visible and attentive.</p>
<p>Another lifeguard offered us additional floatation devices to play with as the 2 younger kids had armbands on. There were plenty of foam frogs and foam rectangles in the pool already and she produced a foam tube which the 2 year old loves when asked.</p>
<p>There is no time limitation on swimming here and the family swim cost was €16.50, which I reckoned was good value. There are 2 changing rooms: male and female. Plenty of lockers, hairdryers and enough bench space. The showers are individual cubicles which I&#8217;m not too fond of, would prefer an open plan shower area where I can see all the kids at all times.</p>
<p>One other advantage of this pool is a poolside bathroom. This I find a great help, as on occasion one or more of the children needs to use the loo and this avoids us all having to leave the pool and traipse back to the changing room.</p>
<p>As we had had a great hour&#8217;s swimming and splashing about in a almost empty pool yesterday morning, we returned this afternoon. Unfortunately there were swimming lessons on, so there was less space.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a jacuzzi and steamroom aswell as a couple of swimming lanes for those serious about their swimming!</p>
<p>Overall, this is a great facility and very handy when we&#8217;re up visiting Granny. Will definitely be returning.</p>

<p class="summary">Great place for a very enjoyable, relaxed family swim.</p>
<p><span class="stars"><img src="http://www.loudervoice.com/static/images/4outof5.gif" /></span></p>
<p class="description">Last bank holiday Monday, the kids were getting antsy so I decided to bring the 4 older ones swimming, to expend some of that excess energy and hopefully have some fun in doing so. So off we headed to Leisureworld.</p>
<p>The first thing I like about Leisureworld is that the changing areas are not split into male and female, as this is usually grounds for contention with the now 8 year old son. He doesn&#8217;t like having to accompany his mammy and younger siblings into the ladies changing room when we swim in the public swimming pool near my mother&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>The general changing area in Leisureworld works well as there are good number (approximately 5) large family changing rooms contained within it, as well as plenty of single changing rooms. So myself and the 4 kids headed into one of large family rooms, all got changed into swimming attire and loaded up one the lockers with our towels/clothes etc. There are loads of lockers, which cost €1 to use, a large communal shower area, usual toilets and hairdryers.</p>
<p>The shower area is also communal which I also like as I can see the kids at all times and there&#8217;s no need to be separated from them and so safer in my view.</p>
<p>There are 3 pools, one 25m, one 18m and a good size toddler pool which I would guess is about 2.5 or 3 ft in depth. This is the one we use. It is deep enough for the older lads to practice their swimming in, whilst the 3 year old feels confident in it, walking and splashing around or holding on to the side, kicking her feet. The 2 year old was very anxious initially, but eventually gained sufficient confidence to start splashing his feet too. There are usually a few foam &#8220;frogs&#8221; or pretend cars in this pool to add to the fun.</p>
<p>The life guards were very visible and appeared to be very attentive to what was going on in all the pools.</p>
<p>We spent a good hour in the pool and the cost for the 5 of us was €16 for a family swim.</p>
<p>Leisureworld has plenty of other facilities such as gym, aerobics, all-weather soccer pitches and a cafe.  They also run swimming lessons. I haven&#8217;t used any of these yet, but hope to make more use of the swimming pool over the next few months after our very enjoyable monday morning there.</p>
<p>The only disadvantage I have found is that on our previous visit both the big 25m pool and the toddler pool were being used for swimming lessons and so we were limited to using the 18m pool which wasn&#8217;t suitable for me with the 3 older kids on my own as the 2 younger ones had to be held constantly in my arms as the water was too deep for them to feel comfortable in on their own. So its a good idea to ring before hand to make sure all pools are available for public use when you intend to go.</p>
