				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It may be Valentine&#8217;s Day tomorrow but romantic or not,  let us not forget that February 14th also marks the start of <a href="https://www.engineersweek.ie/" target="_blank">Engineers Week</a> this year.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/engweek.jog_.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2549" style="border: 2px solid black; margin-left: 31px; margin-right: 31px;" title="engweek.jog" src="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/engweek.jog_.jpg" alt="" width="387" height="96" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;Engineers’ Week is a week long programme of nationwide events with the aim of celebrating the world of engineering in Ireland. The aim of the week is to create a positive awareness and spark enthusiasm about the engineering profession to people of various ages with little or no engineering background.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are many events being run throughout the country aimed at a range of ages. From primary school kids to third level students, families and the general public, there should be something to interest and suit all.</p>
<p>My older children are particularly interested in the &#8220;CEIA Lego Robot Competition Finals&#8221; which are being held in the Maryborough House Hotel in Douglas, Cork on the 17 Feb 2011 from 5:30 to 8pm. In Cork, there appear to be many events taking place in <a href="https://www.bco.ie/" target="_blank">Blackrock Castle Observatory</a> and the <a href="https://www.lifetimelab.ie/" target="_blank">Lifetime lab</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/engweek2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2555" style="border: 2px solid gray; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px;" title="engweek2" src="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/engweek2.jpg" alt="" width="446" height="318" /></a></p>
<p>The Engineers Week website has the <a href="https://www.engineersweek.ie/events-2011/" target="_blank">full schedule of events</a> and a search filter to tailor your choice according to county, date or  audience age. Worth checking out I reckon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Saturday I was fortunate to be invited to attend a <a href="https://www.tots2teens.ie" target="_blank">Tots2Teens</a> one day Paediatric First Aid course which was held in the <a href="https://www.kingsleyhotel.com/" target="_blank">Kingsley Hotel</a> in Cork. When I arrived just after 9am, there were already 15 or so attendees there:  pregnant women, creche employees, dads and mams.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>The course was given by Pat McCarthy of the Cork Ambulance Service and he was just brilliant. With over 10 years experience, there weren&#8217;t too many accident and emergency situations he hadn&#8217;t encountered. His relaxed delivery and extensive knowledge made the day very educational, informative and enjoyable. No question was too stupid. His description of  the scenarios he had dealt with brought the theoretical techniques and procedures sharply into focus.</p>
<p>Baby and child CPR was demonstrated and we each had to practise and show that we could do it.  I was surprised to discover the procedure had changed since my previous first aid course. Similarly what to do if a baby is choking was shown and practised by each participant as well a variety of bandaging methods. The extensive range of first aid scenarios covered is listed on the <a href="https://tots2teens.ie/content/Paediatric%20First%20Aid%20Course/6" target="_blank">Tots2Teens </a>website.</p>
<p>One of Pat&#8217;s top tips if you&#8217;ve children is to put the Poisons Information Centre&#8217;s phone numbers (01 8379964, 01 8379966) in your mobile phone contact list. Done <img src='https://manicmammy.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>I was pretty stunned with how much I had forgotten and it was a great reminder that I could really do with refreshing my first aid skills every few years.  With  lunch included, we finished at approximately 4pm.  It was a day well spent. It was very convenient to get everything covered in a 1 day session rather than having to complete a few evening lessons.</p>
<p>Would thoroughly recommend attending this first aid course if you&#8217;re a parent. I found it excellent.  Further details can be found on the <a href="https://tots2teens.ie/content/Paediatric%20First%20Aid%20Course/6" target="_blank">Tots2Teens website</a>.</p>
