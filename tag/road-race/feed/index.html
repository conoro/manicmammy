				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 4th annual Courtmacsherry to Timoleague 10km road race is taking place on Friday 24th of June 2011 at 8pm. We ran-jogged-jogged very slowly this race last year and it was a really nice run. Its a very flat course which basically starts in Courtmac, follows the path on the water&#8217;s edge to Timoleague and loops back.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/courtmac.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2610" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border: 2px solid gray;" title="courtmac" src="http://www.manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/courtmac.jpg" alt="" width="451" height="195" /></a></p>
<p>You can register in advance by emailing ct10k@yahoo.com or on the day between 5pm and 7.30pm at Courtmacsherry Community Centre. The entry fee is  €10 which covers water and refreshments on the route and post race tea, coffee and sandwiches.</p>
<p>Prize categories: Men &amp; Women Over 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60,, Junior (U16 boys and Girls) Wheelchair Athlete.</p>
<p>€100 bonus to winners if course record is broken: Men: 33.45 Women: 37.42</p>
<p>If the weather is anything like last year&#8217;s for this event, it&#8217;ll be a lovely way to spend a summer&#8217;s evening.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After the <a href="http://www.manicmammy.com/2010/09/15/running-up-that-hill/" target="_blank">hills of Dingle</a>, we decided our next run would be somewhere flat. A google search later, we settled on Galway bay&#8217;s &#8220;fast, flat, fun and very  scenic&#8221; half marathon on October 2nd.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/galwayrun.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2387" style="border: 2px solid gray; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px;" title="galwayrun" src="http://www.manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/galwayrun.jpg" alt="" width="446" height="260" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I was looking forward to this run as I thought I&#8217;d find it much easier than Dingle. However, despite completing it in a faster time, I didn&#8217;t really enjoy it as much. I did like the fact that most of the route was along the salthill promenade and so close to the sea. I didn&#8217;t like the full belt of the wind as we ran out the causeway. I didn&#8217;t enjoy doing two laps of the same course to notch up the requisite half marathon mileage. Also I discovered that I much prefer starting a run early in the morning rather than waiting till 1pm.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I prefered the atmosphere of Dingle. I loved the music at the startline there, it got everyone in top form. There seemed to be more people along the route in Kerry too.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/galway2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2393" style="border: 2px solid gray; margin-left: 11px; margin-right: 11px;" title="galway2" src="http://www.manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/galway2.jpg" alt="" width="428" height="264" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That said, the <a href="www.galwaybayhalfmarathon.com" target="_blank">Galway bay half marathon</a> was, to my eyes, well organised.  The race packs contained a decent running top amongst other goodies. I relished the sambo in the finish pack and it was really nice to have a coffee in the tent after finishing as the day turned inclement. The free massages in the finishing marquee were also a nice touch.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Will probably think about doing this road race again next year but will keep my fingers crossed for less wind and I&#8217;ll know what to expect this time. Now I need to start some decent training as hoping to take part in the <a href="http://www.runclon.ie/" target="_blank">Clonakilty half marathon</a> on December 11th. It looks to have quite a few hills on the route so will be ever so slightly more challenging.</p>
