		<description><![CDATA[Dear Santa, I&#039;m writing to you for my two boys who have had to be brave as well as good this year, you see I&#039;m their mummy and was told in October that I have cancer and our boys have been very good when they have had to stay with other family members. You should have recieved letters about what they would like for chirstmass but could I please ask if you could bring them one extra gift as they have been so good they would like a goal each so they can play football in the garden thank you sooooo much and happy christmass to you and your family.
