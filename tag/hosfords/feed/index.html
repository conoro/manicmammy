As part of this year’s theme  – we have 20 apple trees to donate to schools in West Cork and Cork city.  We would love to see the next generation growing and nurturing trees for their own fruit in the school yard.

<p>Hosfords is located on the main Bandon to Clonakilty road. This sounds like it&#8217;s definitely worth popping into if you&#8217;re in the area next Sunday. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday myself and my 2 youngest decided to head to Hosfords garden centre after spending a lovely sunny morning attempting to sort out a part of our now junglelike garden.</p>
<p>I really like Hosfords. Its very child friendly. The kids love having a gawk at the birds and wallaby out front and the playground at the rear of the cafe is a most excellent idea.  Whilst there, hunger pangs struck and we decided to stay for lunch.</p>
<p>The cafe is lovely, bright and airy. The food is fabulous. The choice for me was difficult. On offer amongst other dishes were a beef thai salad, potato cakes with <a href="https://www.ummera.com/" target="_blank">Ummera</a> smoked salmon, lasagne, quiche lorraine and a decent selection of salads. I settled on an asparagus, spinach and <a href="https://www.gubbeen.com/" target="_blank">Gubbeen</a> cheese quiche accompanied by green salad leaves with french dressing, carrot salad and beetroot. Yep, as you can see from the photo, I had eaten some of it before I remembered to take a picture. Whoops.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 2px solid gray; margin: 10px 135px;" title="Quiche" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3512/3729502076_28c62dac3b_m.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="240" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What I liked also was that the adult dishes were available in half portions, so Fionn had lasagne. Alas Síofra, at 2 years old,  is our fussy eater and is still averse to main meals preferring finger foods so just opted for a fruit scone with jam and butter. There were plenty of carafes of cold drinking water with lemon available.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As the day was sunny, we sat outside at a picnic table adjacent to the playground. My food was delicious. Once the children were finished, they legged it to play on the slide and see saw, leaving me to finish my meal at my own pace and to relax. Perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Would definitely recommend if you&#8217;re travelling to West Cork with or without children.</p>
