				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So the summer has flown and this week is a frenzy of finishing up work, packing and getting ready for our hols. We&#8217;re leaving Bandon for Espana for a couple of weeks. Whilst we&#8217;re gone, my brother, his wife and their three fabulous daughters shall be using our gaff as a base for their West Cork holidays.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_1743" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/71461162@N00/3766294286/" target="_blank"><img style="border: 1px solid gray;" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2645/3766294286_f0603ed5fc.jpg" border="0" alt="IMG_1743" width="450" height="300" /></a><br />

<p>I&#8217;ve decided to make a list of &#8220;Things to Do and See in and around Bandon&#8221; for his family, keeping in mind that the children range in age from 6 years old to 9 months.</p>
<p>This is what I&#8217;ve come up with so far.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.modelvillage.ie" target="_blank">Clonakilty Model Village</a> and train</li>
<li>Inchydoney beach</li>
<li>Playground in Clonakilty</li>
<li>Playground in Bandon</li>
<li>Garretstown beach</li>
<li><a href="https://kinsale.ie/charles-fort/" target="_blank">Charles Fort </a>in Kinsale</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kilbrittainwhale.com/" target="_blank">Whale in Kilbrittain</a></li>
<li>Playground in Timoleague</li>
<li>Nice flat walk from Courtmacsherry to Timoleague along the inlet, suitable for bike rides</li>
<li>If weather is terrible and you feel like a day trip, I would recommend the <a href="https://www.aquadome.ie" target="_blank">Aquadome </a>in Tralee and stop on the way in <a href="https://www.killarneynationalpark.ie/" target="_blank">Killarney National Park</a>. Great playground there. Aquadome good fun. Driving  there takes about an hour and half.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.theparkcinema.com" target="_blank">Cinema</a> in Clonakilty</li>
<li><a href="https://conoroneill.com/2007/09/02/review-of-mccarthys-maize-maze/" target="_blank">McCarthys Maze Trail</a> in Kilbrittain</li>
<li><a href="https://www.fotawildlife.ie/" target="_blank">Fota</a> Wildlife Park</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bandon-Skate-and-Play/177602675595925" target="_blank">Bandon Skate and Play</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So what have I missed? I know there&#8217;s plenty more but nothing else is springing to mind at the moment so any suggestions would be most welcome!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 4th annual Courtmacsherry to Timoleague 10km road race is taking place on Friday 24th of June 2011 at 8pm. We ran-jogged-jogged very slowly this race last year and it was a really nice run. Its a very flat course which basically starts in Courtmac, follows the path on the water&#8217;s edge to Timoleague and loops back.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/courtmac.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2610" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border: 2px solid gray;" title="courtmac" src="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/courtmac.jpg" alt="" width="451" height="195" /></a></p>
<p>You can register in advance by emailing ct10k@yahoo.com or on the day between 5pm and 7.30pm at Courtmacsherry Community Centre. The entry fee is  €10 which covers water and refreshments on the route and post race tea, coffee and sandwiches.</p>
<p>Prize categories: Men &amp; Women Over 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60,, Junior (U16 boys and Girls) Wheelchair Athlete.</p>
<p>€100 bonus to winners if course record is broken: Men: 33.45 Women: 37.42</p>
<p>If the weather is anything like last year&#8217;s for this event, it&#8217;ll be a lovely way to spend a summer&#8217;s evening.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last December&#8217;s <a href="https://www.runclon.ie/" target="_blank">Clonakilty half marathon</a> was  good fun. Despite the morning being freezing, the atmosphere at the startline  was brilliant with music playing, runners looking forward to the off and plenty of supporters about. The run itself was enjoyable with a few hills to keep me on my toes and plenty of scenic views to keep my mind distracted.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/clonrun.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2516" style="border: 2px solid gray;" title="Clonakilty Marathon and Half Marathon" src="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/clonrun.jpg" alt="" width="451" height="251" /></a></p>
<p>Alas since then, there has been a dearth of  running events in my calendar. I need to have a race to look forward to to keep my running motivation up, so I was delighted to hear about a few upcoming half marathons.</p>
<p>First is the <a href="https://www.activeglobal.com/running/kilarney-ireland/wild-west-run-trail-half-marathon-2011" target="_blank">Wild West Run</a> which takes place on the 19th of February.  Starting at 2pm, in Kenmare and running a trail half marathon to Kilarney, along the beautiful Old Kerry way, the entry fee is €40.</p>
<p>The next is the inaugural <a href="https://www.runireland.com/events/bandon-half-marathon-and-10k" target="_blank">Bandon Half Marathon</a>. <a href="https://www.bandonac.org/wordpress/" target="_blank">Bandon Athletics Club</a> and <a href="https://bandonrfc.com/" target="_blank">Bandon Rugby Club</a> are working together to organise a 10k and half marathon on the 14th May. I&#8217;m really delighted to hear about this one. Its great value for money at an entry fee of only €20. Well done to the organisers and best of luck. I will definitely, barring catastrophy, be taking part in the <a href="https://www.bandonhalfmarathon.com/" target="_blank">Bandon run</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/corkmarathon.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2521" style="border: 2px solid gray; margin-left: 110px; margin-right: 110px;" title="cork city marathon" src="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/corkmarathon.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="307" /></a></p>
<p>Finally, in addition to the usual <a href="https://www.corkcitymarathon.ie/" target="_blank">Cork Marathon</a> taking place on June 6th, the organisers have announced a <a href="https://www.corkcitymarathon.ie/therace/halfmarathon/" target="_blank">half marathon</a> race. This is a most welcome extra race for those not inclined to tackle a full marathon nor organise a relay team. It should be a great day. The online <a href="https://www.corkcitymarathon.ie/entry/" target="_blank">entry fee</a> for this race ranges from €42 prior to 31/03/2011 to €62 in May 2011.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s me sorted for the next while. Now to put in the miles before these races&#8230;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">We had good fun at the <a href="https://www.spwc.ie/cork/home.swf" target="_blank">Street Performance World Championship</a> last year and are hoping to head into Cork en famille to enjoy it again this year.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Breakdancers, clowns, jugglers, comedians, dancers, magicans, contortionists, games, face painting. a playground and much much more. There is also an extensive range and variety of food stalls so you won&#8217;t go hungry. Our older kids were particularly enthralled by one of the magicans last year, a captivating and entertaining show.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Looks like the weather&#8217;s going to be sunny, so really looking forward to this family fun day out tomorrow. If you&#8217;re not near Cork, you can also catch it in <a href="https://www.spwc.ie/dublin/home.swf" target="_blank">Dublin&#8217;s Merrion Square</a> next week. Well worth a visit, would recommend.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I dropped my battered, old Zafira into the garage to have the brake pads and coolant system checked as had been getting the ominous scrapping sound on braking and a flashing warning coolant light on the dashboard.</p>
<p><a title="Track rubber" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/76842350@N00/442827405/" target="_blank"><img style="border: 2px solid gray;" src="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/182/442827405_7b5622b2a7.jpg" border="0" alt="Track rubber" width="450" height="304" /></a><br />

<p>When I collected the car a few hours later to pony up the dosh for the replacement brake pads, I noticed on the car&#8217;s checklist a &#8220;no spare wheel&#8221; note. Eek.</p>
<p>When did that go missing? Presumbly it was present on my previous car service a few months ago as that box was ticked then.  Where did it go? Its attached to the car&#8217;s underside rather than stashed in the boot.</p>
<p>The garage guy told me there&#8217;d been a spate of robberies of spare wheels from carparks around Cork in recent times. First I&#8217;ve heard of it. Has this happened to anyone else?</p>
<p>I was quite stunned. Bizarre. Have ordered new spare wheel which looks like it&#8217;s going to cost the best part of €200. Bloody expensive. Time for my annoyed face or what Fionn calls his &#8220;angry (eye) lashes&#8221; .</p>

<p>Myself and Oscar headed into Cork this morning on the advice of his mate Cian. Both the boys are hugely into skateboarding at the moment and its fabulous to see such enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The purpose of this visit to <a href="https://tubes.ie/" target="_blank">Tubes</a> on Cook Street was to purchase new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skateboard_trucks#Truckshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skateboard_trucks#Truckshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skateboard_trucks#Trucks" target="_blank">trucks</a> for Oscar&#8217;s skateboard. Since Christmas his skateboarding has improved in leaps and bounds so he is doing more moves, jumps etc so he wanted more manoeuvrability with his board. He has been saving, so all his cash was gathered and in I drove.</p>
<p>Tubes is easy to find and packed full of snowboarding, surfing and skateboard equipment and attire. Oscar was in heaven. The young sales assistant was brilliant. He gave us great advice after listening to Oscar&#8217;s predictament. The service was friendly and top notch. Oscar appreciated the fact that the sales guy was a skateboarder himself and knew exactly what Oscar was talking about. The trucks were purchased.</p>
<p>Oscar has already started saving for his next visit and I also now know where to go when I wish to purchase snowboarding gear. We&#8217;ll definitely be returning soon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.karwigwines.ie"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1225" style="border: 2px solid gray;" title="karwigs wines" src="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/karwigs.jpg" alt="" width="467" height="209" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Over the Christmas break, I finally managed a sneaky visit to <a href="https://www.karwigwines.ie" target="_blank">Karwig wines</a> in Carrigaline. Its not the easiest place to find, as I&#8217;m not that familiar with Carrigaline, but I diligently followed the <a href="https://www.karwigwines.ie/Visit_Us.asp" target="_blank">directions on their website</a> and arrived without too much hassle.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Joe Karwig, originally from Bremen in Germany, arrived in Cork over thirty years ago. He&#8217;s a man after my own heart as he reserves a special place for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riesling" target="_blank">Riesling</a>, which he regards as the &#8220;best white grape in the world&#8221;. His shop, understandably has a extensive range of wonderful wines from Germany. But the choice of wine is by no means limited to one country.  France, Spain, Italy, Portugal are all very well represented as well as Lebanon. Plenty of New World wines from Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, South Africa, Chile and America.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There is a tasting room and many older, rarer wines are on display. Maurice O&#8217;Mahony, Karwigs marketing manager gave me the guided tour and I tasted a couple of pinot grigios, some shiraz, riesling and rioja. It was great to have an opportunity to sample, compare and contrast the wines prior to purchase.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Aside from the shop, Karwigs has recently launched a new website which includes an <a href="https://www.karwigwines.ie/default.asp" target="_blank">online store</a> and <a href="https://karwigwines.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>. New wines are being added to this continually so its worth having a look on a regular basis  and subscribing to the blog to get the excellent blogposts. I found the website easy to use and handy for browsing the range of wines.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I left Karwigs very happy with my new wine purchases. Looking forward to trying them in the next while and to revisiting the store in the not too distant future. If you&#8217;re in the vicinity, pop in, else have a gander online.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently Sibéal, our carnivore aged 5, was chomping on some steak as is her wont, when she started going very red in the face and making a godawful noise. She was choking and we needed to do something asap. Its been 10 years since I did a first aid course,  shortly after Oscar was born, so most of what I&#8217;ve learnt is a bit hazy. Thankfully on this occasion, the food had only partially blocked her airway and we were able to remove it quickly.</p>
<p>The whole episode reminded me acutely that I need to refresh my first aid skills very soon. I need to know whats the correct and fastest course of action without having to think about it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.tots2teens.ie"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 2px solid gray; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" title="tots2teens" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3467/3932967821_a481775fb1_o.jpg" alt="" width="352" height="171" /></a></p>
<p>It was therefore a very welcomed coincidence when<a href="https://www.tots2teens.ie/content/About%20Us/2" target="_blank"> Claire and Martina</a> from <a href="https://tots2teens.ie" target="_blank">Tots2Teens</a> parenting website contacted me about their 1 day intensive  <a href="https://tots2teens.ie/content/paediatric%20First%20Aid/6" target="_blank">Pediatric First Aid Courses</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think its a brilliant idea.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">An extensive range of first aid scenarios and treatment is covered in one day:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Approach to an accident</li>
<li>Disorders of breathing and CPR</li>
<li>Wounds, bleeding and trauma</li>
<li>Fractures and broken bones</li>
<li>Burns and scalds</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Medical Emergencies</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">The next few courses are running in the following locations on these dates:</p>
<p>3rd October 2009 &amp; 7th November 2009   &#8211; Bewleys Hotel, Ballsbridge, Dublin 4<br />
17th October 2009 &amp; 14th November 2009 &#8211; Kingsley Hotel, Victoria Cross, Cork</p>
<p>It costs €140 per person or €250 per couple. As a parent, I believe this is great value for something I hope I&#8217;ll never have to use but chances are, with kids, I will. Being prepared, knowing how to assess the scenario and apply the right procedure is crucial for my peace of mind. Looking forward to attending the Cork course.</p>
