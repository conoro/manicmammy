		<description><![CDATA[This stuff is really interesting.  I have recently returned to Ireland and am looking for a haairdresser.  Thought about PM thinking they can&#039;t still be that bad.... it seems they are, and I&#039;m going back 20 years.  how do they keep going with such ignorant service. Thanks for the warning.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just got the worst cut ever in Peter marks Douglas. Described in detail how I wanted my hair cut but the so called stylist didn&#039;t seem to be listening. Turned out to be the case as my cut was a total disaster and far too short. When I complained I was told by the manager that I had been given the cut I had asked for and they refused to reimburse me. Was a loyal customer but will never set foot inside the place Again. Their treatment of customers is appalling as I was basically accused of lying]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seriously Peter marks is a disgrace. Simone was good but has since left and opened her own business in black rock but I have not been. I feel Peter marks dont even wash my hair properly. They constantly critise the state of my hair too. Pathetic ! If anyone can suggest somewhere else please let me know !!!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve just had my hair done in winthrop street and I&#039;m not impressed. I feel that peter mark in general would want to focus alot more on  customer service when they are training there staff....As customer you are made to feel like an inconvenience. The girl who was doing my hair had to keep leaving me to deal with her other clients.She seemed to be more interested in the next client than my hair.At this stage I will be finding another hairdressers one who at least appreciates the custom.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am tired of going to Peter Mark Salon! Lots of inconsistency with their hairdressers. Douglas experienced wasn&#039;t good, wilton wasn&#039;t good. Tried mahon point and first hairdresses, she was very good, that it kept me from going there. But that was only once I catch up with her. I had my hair done twice after that satisfied experienced but then 2 failed. Another lady that was fully occupied with another client while I was there in the chair waiting to be attended. Last one was crap... wash, cut my hair for 3 minutes without even checking for uneven length and got it curled and it was done crap. Came home, feel not so sure how it will turn out the next day... ya I was right, uneven cut, or barely trimmed at all. I will look elsewhere now where it will be worth and happy with my hair after.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[peter mark in Merchants key is also awful. I just wanted a basic trim and I am new to Cork so I thought I would try a &#039;safe bet&#039;.the girl who did my hair was so ignorant. She criticized the colour of my hair even though I didnt ask her to anything with colour. (Iput semi permanent in dark brown in my hair, very close to natural colour to hide a few sneaky greys, had a bad experience in peter mark galway a few yrs ago,got orange hair instead of brown) She pretty much called me stupid because I didnt realize that the hair dye companies lie about whther it is permanent or not. 
She spoke to me at begining  and then dealt with her client beside me, cut my hair and trainee did everything else.she bossed trainee around she was a dog. I wish Icould remember her name because I would shame here as she deserves nothing more. she was blonde and this was a few months ago.

		<description><![CDATA[I am a trainee hairdresser, i have just completed my first year, not saying im a pro or anything but i know my basics.

Having been advised go to Peter Mark&#039;s (wilton) i did so, and boy was i shocked leaving the salon.

Upon entering the salon nobody offered to take my belongings, i had to keep them by my feet and haul them around with me when i was required to attend the basin. Also I was not offered tea/coffee.

What i required from the salon was a full mesh of blonde and brown, the colours being applyed to my hair were never discussed with me only to have the stylist approach me (after leaving me sit and wait ten minutes) with a colour chart and say these are the colours i will be applying to your hair.

Once the service finally went underway it took the stylist THREE hours to apply the colour (5.30-8.30),during this period the stylist seemed very fustrated even in the middle of it while trying to detangle my hair saying J**** C*****, i myself was boling at that stage, need i say?? 
But putting myself in the trainee stylists position i was doing my up-most best to keep myself from running out the door(mesh and all)!!!

When we got to rinsing out my colour, i was asked &quot;Ah Do you still require your hair to be cut??&quot;, that to me suggested that she did not want to cut my hair, and at this stage it was 8.40pm and the salon closed at 9, it would have been some cut, so i told her no just blast dry it and let that be that...

To top it all they required the same price i had been quoated at the start, even though i got no cut or blowdry..

Never Go to this salon no matter how good your told it is.
Seems to me they have there name well established and just dont give a crap......

Id have been better off at a dog grooming parlour, I know this seems harsh but O.M.F.G!!!
I left the salon in tears with a burnt head of hair..... NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!]]></description>
