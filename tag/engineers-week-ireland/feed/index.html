				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It may be Valentine&#8217;s Day tomorrow but romantic or not,  let us not forget that February 14th also marks the start of <a href="https://www.engineersweek.ie/" target="_blank">Engineers Week</a> this year.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/engweek.jog_.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2549" style="border: 2px solid black; margin-left: 31px; margin-right: 31px;" title="engweek.jog" src="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/engweek.jog_.jpg" alt="" width="387" height="96" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;Engineers’ Week is a week long programme of nationwide events with the aim of celebrating the world of engineering in Ireland. The aim of the week is to create a positive awareness and spark enthusiasm about the engineering profession to people of various ages with little or no engineering background.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are many events being run throughout the country aimed at a range of ages. From primary school kids to third level students, families and the general public, there should be something to interest and suit all.</p>
<p>My older children are particularly interested in the &#8220;CEIA Lego Robot Competition Finals&#8221; which are being held in the Maryborough House Hotel in Douglas, Cork on the 17 Feb 2011 from 5:30 to 8pm. In Cork, there appear to be many events taking place in <a href="https://www.bco.ie/" target="_blank">Blackrock Castle Observatory</a> and the <a href="https://www.lifetimelab.ie/" target="_blank">Lifetime lab</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/engweek2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2555" style="border: 2px solid gray; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px;" title="engweek2" src="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/engweek2.jpg" alt="" width="446" height="318" /></a></p>
<p>The Engineers Week website has the <a href="https://www.engineersweek.ie/events-2011/" target="_blank">full schedule of events</a> and a search filter to tailor your choice according to county, date or  audience age. Worth checking out I reckon.</p>
