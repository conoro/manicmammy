				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sunday May 1st at 10am saw myself, 3 of my siblings and other pals running through a forest in Virginia, Co. Cavan. Why? I hear you ask. Well, it was the first <a href="https://www.jailbreak.ie" target="_blank">Jailbreak 10km trail run</a>. We were going to be up and about early anyway as our Dad&#8217;s anniversary mass was taking place at 8am so we jumped into the car after it and a quick drive to Virginia later, we were set.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/vj1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2603" style="margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px;" title="vj" src="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/vj1.jpg" alt="" width="441" height="107" /></a></p>
<p>Some runners were assigned to be &#8220;prisoners&#8221; and they started the run a minute before the runners who were assigned to be &#8220;guards&#8221; took off in pursuit. Each guard was supposed to try and catch the same bib numbered prisoner. Alas I was the guard who was supposed to catch my prisoner brother who had recently completed the Paris marathon. No chance. The sibling rivalry kicked in and he took off!</p>
<p>It was great fun. The morning was gorgeous, sun out, bluebells growing in the forest. Some of the trail was along the lake so plenty of lovely vistas to keep us distracted from the running. We all thoroughly enjoyed it. For €25 registration fee, everyone received either an orange prisoner or a navy guard t-shirt, a handcuff shaped finisher&#8217;s medal and water en-route and at the finish line.</p>
<p>I would definitely recommend this trail run and intend to take part again next year. Good craic and a lovely way to start the day!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This time 10 years ago, we were married for 6 months or so and it was fast approaching Conor&#8217;s 30th birthday. At the time, I was working for TEAM Aer Lingus doing my aircraft engineer thang and had what must be one of the best work perks evah: flight concessions.</p>
<p>Zonal tickets were the business. Get yourself a couple of those and off you went, the choice of many airlines to whatever destination the outgoing plane which had seats free was going to.  Competitions to see who could get the furthest leaving on a Friday and back for Monday morning. Good fun.</p>
<p>So for his 30th, I booked the concession tickets and we headed to New York for the weekend on Concorde. It was brilliant, we arrived in NY 2 hours before we left London hitting Mach 2 on the way. The Pierces came up from Virginia, we stayed in the World Trade Center Marriott and spent the weekend hitting the tourist spots. Definitely a weekend to remember.</p>
<p>A year later, I gave birth to our first son on my 30th birthday. He arrived 5 days early and it was a completely different but even more memorable celebration. Midwives singing &#8220;happy birthday&#8221; whilst I was in labour is something I will never forget.</p>

<p>So now, 5 kids later and our 40s fast approaching, life has changed dramatically and celebrations take a bit more planning. Initially I had contemplated doing a F1 trip: someday it would be brilliant to attend the Monte Carlo Grand Prix. But for now, its too expensive and hardly child friendly. Then we thought of a ski trip en famille but again, it may be better to wait till the children are a bit older. Maybe just bring the older kids, nah, that didnt seem right either. We better make the most of them wanting to travel with us. Somehow I doubt it&#8217;ll be as easy when we&#8217;re hitting 50. </p>
<p>So today, at his request,  I booked the final part of Conor&#8217;s 40th celebration and we&#8217;re all off to Legoland Windsor in May. It seems perfect and fitting that we celebrate this stage of our lives together with all our children. Time is passing so bloody quickly. Legoland should be fun.</p>
