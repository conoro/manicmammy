				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So the summer has flown and this week is a frenzy of finishing up work, packing and getting ready for our hols. We&#8217;re leaving Bandon for Espana for a couple of weeks. Whilst we&#8217;re gone, my brother, his wife and their three fabulous daughters shall be using our gaff as a base for their West Cork holidays.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve decided to make a list of &#8220;Things to Do and See in and around Bandon&#8221; for his family, keeping in mind that the children range in age from 6 years old to 9 months.</p>
<p>This is what I&#8217;ve come up with so far.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.modelvillage.ie" target="_blank">Clonakilty Model Village</a> and train</li>
<li>Inchydoney beach</li>
<li>Playground in Clonakilty</li>
<li>Playground in Bandon</li>
<li>Garretstown beach</li>
<li><a href="https://kinsale.ie/charles-fort/" target="_blank">Charles Fort </a>in Kinsale</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kilbrittainwhale.com/" target="_blank">Whale in Kilbrittain</a></li>
<li>Playground in Timoleague</li>
<li>Nice flat walk from Courtmacsherry to Timoleague along the inlet, suitable for bike rides</li>
<li>If weather is terrible and you feel like a day trip, I would recommend the <a href="https://www.aquadome.ie" target="_blank">Aquadome </a>in Tralee and stop on the way in <a href="https://www.killarneynationalpark.ie/" target="_blank">Killarney National Park</a>. Great playground there. Aquadome good fun. Driving  there takes about an hour and half.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.theparkcinema.com" target="_blank">Cinema</a> in Clonakilty</li>
<li><a href="https://conoroneill.com/2007/09/02/review-of-mccarthys-maize-maze/" target="_blank">McCarthys Maze Trail</a> in Kilbrittain</li>
<li><a href="https://www.fotawildlife.ie/" target="_blank">Fota</a> Wildlife Park</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bandon-Skate-and-Play/177602675595925" target="_blank">Bandon Skate and Play</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So what have I missed? I know there&#8217;s plenty more but nothing else is springing to mind at the moment so any suggestions would be most welcome!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy New Year to all!</p>
<p>Lately real life has gotten in the way of blogging. I hope everyone had a lovely festive season. Our children are still off school but we&#8217;ve returned to Bandon after visiting Kilkenny and Cavan, both of which were without running water at times due to the icy weather and its effects. Definitely glad to return to hot running water!</p>
<p>In the post recently I received the following notifications which I thought may be of interest.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ctyi2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2506" style="border: 2px solid gray; margin-left: 127px; margin-right: 127px;" title="ctyi2" src="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ctyi2.jpg" alt="" width="195" height="120" /></a></p>
<p>The first is the <a href="https://www.dcu.ie/ctyi/index.shtml" target="_blank">CTYI</a> taster day  for 8 to 12 year olds to be held in <a href="https://www.dcu.ie/index.shtml" target="_blank">DCU</a> and <a href="https://www.ucc.ie/en/" target="_blank">UCC</a> on the 15th of January 2011.</p>
<blockquote><p>This is a one day event to give children a &#8220;taste&#8221; of what it is like to attend a course at one of our centres. It is to give potential students an idea of what happens on our Saturday and summer program and helps give these students an idea whether they would enjoy coming. It also gives students who already come a chance to try out new subjects.<br />
DCU: 10.00 &#8211; 12.15pm or 1.00 to 3.15pm<br />
UCC: 1.00 &#8211; 3.15pm<br />
Cost is €10 per child for morning or afternoon or €20 for both DCU sessions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Two subjects will be studied on the day and there is a good range to choose from including:</p>
<ul>
<li>forensics and vet science</li>
<li>film studies and creative writing</li>
<li>computer animation  and science in space</li>
<li>architecture and astronomy</li>
</ul>
<p>I would definitely recommend these <a href="https://www.dcu.ie/ctyi/index.shtml" target="_blank">CTYI</a> days. Our eldest son thoroughly enjoys attending and learning about a wide variety of subjects. For further information, please contact Eleanor Cooke at eleanor.cooke@dcu.ie or 01 7008977.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/gaiety.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2503" style="border: 2px solid gray; margin-left: 23px; margin-right: 23px;" title="gaiety" src="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/gaiety.jpg" alt="" width="414" height="162" /></a></p>
<p>The second is a free trial day at the <a href="https://www.gaietyschool.com/" target="_blank">Gaiety School of Acting</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>CHILDRENS TRY FOR FREE</p>
<p>Have you a Saoirse Ronan or a Jaden Smith in your house? A child pestering you to let them go to drama. Here&#8217;s you chance to bring them along and see what&#8217;s what. This term we&#8217;re running our TRY FOR FREE classes in Temple Bar, Bray, Wexford and Castleblayney.</p>
<p>Classes will run on Saturday 8th Jan.</p>
<p>Call us on (01) 6799277 for the scheduled times and to guarantee your place. Alternatively just call down on the day.</p>
<p>Gaiety School of Acting, Temple Bar &#8211; 4 years old &#8211; 18 years old</p>
<p>Mermaid Arts Centre, Bray &#8211; 7 years old &#8211; 18 years old</p>
<p>Wexford Arts Centre, Wexford &#8211; 6 years old &#8211; 13 years old</p>
<p>Iontas Arts Centre, Castleblayney &#8211; 6 years old &#8211; 13 years old</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, I would recommend these days too as one of our children did a Saturday course in Cork with the Gaiety School of Acting a year or so ago and enjoyed it.</p>
