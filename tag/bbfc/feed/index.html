				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My kids love going to the cinema and I must admit I do love accompanying them. This is true barring the odd exception such  &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cats_%26_Dogs:_The_Revenge_of_Kitty_Galore" target="_blank">Cats and Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore</a>&#8221; which we all agreed was an dreadful movie.</p>
<p>I became aware of the <a href="https://www.bbfc.co.uk" target="_blank">bbfc</a> (British Board of Film Classification) website after listening to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/kermode" target="_blank">Radio 5&#8242;s film review podcasts</a>. The parents&#8217; version, <a href="https://www.pbbfc.co.uk" target="_blank">pbbfc</a> is really useful. I find myself referring to it frequently when deciding what film to go see with the children. It gives the ratings of all movies and clarifies why these ratings have been given.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.pbbfc.co.uk"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2565" style="margin-left: 7px; margin-right: 7px;" title="pbbfc" src="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/pbbfc.jpg" alt="" width="435" height="350" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>On this site you will find detailed information about all new films for the cinema rated &#8216;U&#8217;, &#8216;PG&#8217; or &#8217;12A&#8217;, films released on DVD at these categories and all video games rated by the BBFC. This information is called <a href="https://www.pbbfc.co.uk/guides_parentInfo.asp">Extended Classification Information </a> &#8211; it explains exactly what issues (eg violence, sex, language) are raised in a film, DVD or game and gives clear examples.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is also now a free <a href="https://www.bbfc.co.uk/_featured/bbfc-app-for-iphone" target="_blank">BBFC iphone application</a> available. I have already downloaded it and it is brilliant. Really easy to use, you have all the relevant information at your finger tips. It will be especially useful for those odd times when we&#8217;re out and about and the movie we had intended to view is sold out and an alternative needs to be selected.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/bbfc.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2567" style="margin-left: 12px; margin-right: 12px;" title="bbfc" src="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/bbfc.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="306" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The extended classification information is very detailed which is excellent as it allows you to make a genuinely informed decision to what movie your child will see and what innuendo, violence etc they may be exposed to. Love it.</p>
