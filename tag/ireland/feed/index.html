				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So the summer has flown and this week is a frenzy of finishing up work, packing and getting ready for our hols. We&#8217;re leaving Bandon for Espana for a couple of weeks. Whilst we&#8217;re gone, my brother, his wife and their three fabulous daughters shall be using our gaff as a base for their West Cork holidays.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_1743" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/71461162@N00/3766294286/" target="_blank"><img style="border: 1px solid gray;" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2645/3766294286_f0603ed5fc.jpg" border="0" alt="IMG_1743" width="450" height="300" /></a><br />

<p>I&#8217;ve decided to make a list of &#8220;Things to Do and See in and around Bandon&#8221; for his family, keeping in mind that the children range in age from 6 years old to 9 months.</p>
<p>This is what I&#8217;ve come up with so far.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.modelvillage.ie" target="_blank">Clonakilty Model Village</a> and train</li>
<li>Inchydoney beach</li>
<li>Playground in Clonakilty</li>
<li>Playground in Bandon</li>
<li>Garretstown beach</li>
<li><a href="https://kinsale.ie/charles-fort/" target="_blank">Charles Fort </a>in Kinsale</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kilbrittainwhale.com/" target="_blank">Whale in Kilbrittain</a></li>
<li>Playground in Timoleague</li>
<li>Nice flat walk from Courtmacsherry to Timoleague along the inlet, suitable for bike rides</li>
<li>If weather is terrible and you feel like a day trip, I would recommend the <a href="https://www.aquadome.ie" target="_blank">Aquadome </a>in Tralee and stop on the way in <a href="https://www.killarneynationalpark.ie/" target="_blank">Killarney National Park</a>. Great playground there. Aquadome good fun. Driving  there takes about an hour and half.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.theparkcinema.com" target="_blank">Cinema</a> in Clonakilty</li>
<li><a href="https://conoroneill.com/2007/09/02/review-of-mccarthys-maize-maze/" target="_blank">McCarthys Maze Trail</a> in Kilbrittain</li>
<li><a href="https://www.fotawildlife.ie/" target="_blank">Fota</a> Wildlife Park</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bandon-Skate-and-Play/177602675595925" target="_blank">Bandon Skate and Play</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So what have I missed? I know there&#8217;s plenty more but nothing else is springing to mind at the moment so any suggestions would be most welcome!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It may be Valentine&#8217;s Day tomorrow but romantic or not,  let us not forget that February 14th also marks the start of <a href="https://www.engineersweek.ie/" target="_blank">Engineers Week</a> this year.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/engweek.jog_.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2549" style="border: 2px solid black; margin-left: 31px; margin-right: 31px;" title="engweek.jog" src="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/engweek.jog_.jpg" alt="" width="387" height="96" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;Engineers’ Week is a week long programme of nationwide events with the aim of celebrating the world of engineering in Ireland. The aim of the week is to create a positive awareness and spark enthusiasm about the engineering profession to people of various ages with little or no engineering background.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are many events being run throughout the country aimed at a range of ages. From primary school kids to third level students, families and the general public, there should be something to interest and suit all.</p>
<p>My older children are particularly interested in the &#8220;CEIA Lego Robot Competition Finals&#8221; which are being held in the Maryborough House Hotel in Douglas, Cork on the 17 Feb 2011 from 5:30 to 8pm. In Cork, there appear to be many events taking place in <a href="https://www.bco.ie/" target="_blank">Blackrock Castle Observatory</a> and the <a href="https://www.lifetimelab.ie/" target="_blank">Lifetime lab</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/engweek2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2555" style="border: 2px solid gray; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px;" title="engweek2" src="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/engweek2.jpg" alt="" width="446" height="318" /></a></p>
<p>The Engineers Week website has the <a href="https://www.engineersweek.ie/events-2011/" target="_blank">full schedule of events</a> and a search filter to tailor your choice according to county, date or  audience age. Worth checking out I reckon.</p>

<p>Her <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/Q6XCDRN" target="_blank">survey</a> is very short and straightforward. So g&#8217;wan, help out a student and give it a go<a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/Q6XCDRN" target="_blank"> here</a>.</p>
