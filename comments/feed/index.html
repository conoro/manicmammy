		<description><![CDATA[I bought two tickets for my sister and her daughter to go to America for a holday at the peak of the season but there were unable to go so I gave the tickets to my brother and his girlfriend. The dates did not suit them so they wanted to move the dates to later in the year off peak season and are being charged €377 per person. 100 on the name change 100 per flight for the change of date and 77 for a change of fare. I fly with aer lngus regularly or at least I used to and when I asked if any of these charges could be waived I was given a flat out no. Last time I will be booking a flight with aer fungus as it is known in American air ports and not without cause.]]></description>

Thanks for the warning.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello
I am coming to Bandon next week.  In an effort to try and look vaguely groomed (I can control my nails, the rest of me is heading south you see)  I have started to have gel manicures, non-chip, that last for two weeks then need replacing.  You don&#039;t happen to know anywhere that does these do you?  I found somewhere in Clonakility but it looks pricey.
Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks Zena x]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just got the worst cut ever in Peter marks Douglas. Described in detail how I wanted my hair cut but the so called stylist didn&#039;t seem to be listening. Turned out to be the case as my cut was a total disaster and far too short. When I complained I was told by the manager that I had been given the cut I had asked for and they refused to reimburse me. Was a loyal customer but will never set foot inside the place Again. Their treatment of customers is appalling as I was basically accused of lying]]></description>

I feel Peter marks dont even wash my hair properly. They constantly critise the state of my hair too. Pathetic ! If anyone can suggest somewhere else please let me know !!!!!]]></description>
