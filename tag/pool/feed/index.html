				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of Sundays ago, we awoke to a rainy dull day in Bandon. So myself and 3 of the kids decided to hit the road to Tralee. We had been meaning to try out its Aquadome for ages so it seemed like the perfect opportunity to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="www.aquadome.ie"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2574" style="border: 2px solid gray; margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px;" title="aquadome" src="https://manicmammy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/aquadome.jpg" alt="" width="442" height="328" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To make a long story short, we had a terrific day there, spending over 2 hours in the pool. The children loved the intervals when waves would traverse the pool. The smaller slides were perfect for the 5 year old, whilst his older siblings tackled the much larger flume slide.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The lazy river, various water showers and sprays, jacuzzi and spa pools were all tried and tested. It was great fun.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">8 year olds and younger have to wear arm bands which is no harm as parts of the pool complex have water depths which are above their heights. I felt the whole set up was very well run. There were plenty of staff and life guards keeping an eye out.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My only minor gripe is that I felt the individual changing rooms were on the small side. I would have preferred a larger family one in which we all could have been accomodated rather than the hassle of splitting the children up into their own rooms.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is quite expensive but there is a good deal on offer at the moment where you get a second family visit for half price which we availed of the following week which I guess is another indication of how much we liked the place. It was a great way to spend an otherwise dreary Sunday and I can definitely see us heading there quite often over the next few months.</p>

<p>Its that time of the year again and the paddling pools are being brought out into back gardens. Last year I bought a 10ft easy set pool and cover for round about the €100 mark. I figured it looked sturdy and would take plenty of abuse from our darlings! It was big and looked like good fun. </p>
<p>Alas it was only when I got it home, unpacked and started to try and assemble and fill it with water that I realised my mistake. This pool REALLY requires a totally flat surface to work. If it is placed on any sort of a slope, however small, the pool will not fill properly with water, one side will slope and water will continually spill out and the sides of the pool will not stand. It also needs a smooth surface. It is quite difficult once it starts filling with water to get all the creases out of the base of it. </p>
<p>I was really disappointed. We tried it on the patio, on several places around the garden but to no avail. None of the locations were level enough. In the end, I donated it to my brother in the hope his garden will suit it better. </p>
