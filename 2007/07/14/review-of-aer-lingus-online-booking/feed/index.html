		<description><![CDATA[I bought two tickets for my sister and her daughter to go to America for a holday at the peak of the season but there were unable to go so I gave the tickets to my brother and his girlfriend. The dates did not suit them so they wanted to move the dates to later in the year off peak season and are being charged €377 per person. 100 on the name change 100 per flight for the change of date and 77 for a change of fare. I fly with aer lngus regularly or at least I used to and when I asked if any of these charges could be waived I was given a flat out no. Last time I will be booking a flight with aer fungus as it is known in American air ports and not without cause.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In my opinion Aer Lingus have a very poor standard of customer service. 
They own 500 Euro relating to Volcanic Ash Disruption in April 2010 and six months later nothing.

But they refuse to contact me about this.

I do not think I will travel with Aer Lingus again.]]></description>
