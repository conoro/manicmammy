		<description><![CDATA[Hello
I am coming to Bandon next week.  In an effort to try and look vaguely groomed (I can control my nails, the rest of me is heading south you see)  I have started to have gel manicures, non-chip, that last for two weeks then need replacing.  You don&#039;t happen to know anywhere that does these do you?  I found somewhere in Clonakility but it looks pricey.
Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks Zena x]]></description>
